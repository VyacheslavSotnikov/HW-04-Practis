<h2>Types of engines</h2>
</br>
<h3><i><strong>1. Heat engine</strong></i></h3>
<p>In thermodynamics and engineering, a <em>heat engine</em> is a system that converts heat to usable energy, particularly
    mechanical energy, which can then be used to do mechanical work.
    <br/>While originally conceived in the context of
    mechanical energy, the concept of the heat engine has been applied to various other kinds of energy, particularly
    electrical, since at least the late 19th century.[3][4] The heat engine does this by bringing a working substance
    from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature.
    <br/>A heat source generates thermal energy that brings the
    working substance to the higher temperature state. The working substance generates work in the working body of the
    engine while transferring heat to the colder sink until it reaches a lower temperature state. During this process
    some of the thermal energy is converted into work by exploiting the properties of the working substance. The working
    substance can be any system with a non-zero heat capacity, but it usually is a gas or liquid. During this process,
    some heat is normally lost to the surroundings and is not converted to work. Also, some energy is unusable because
    of friction and drag.</p>

<h3><i><strong>2. Internal combustion enginec</strong></i></h3>
<p><em>The internal combustion engine</em> is an engine in which the combustion of a fuel (generally, fossil fuel) occurs with an
    oxidizer (usually air) in a combustion chamber.
    <br/>In an <em>internal combustion engine</em> the expansion of the high
    temperature and high pressure gases, which are produced by the combustion, directly applies force to components of
    the engine, such as the pistons or turbine blades or a nozzle, and by moving it over a distance, generates
    mechanical work.</p>

<h3><i><strong>3. External combustion engine</strong></i></h3>
<p>An <em>external combustion engine</em> (EC engine) is a heat engine where an internal working fluid is heated by combustion of
    an external source, through the engine wall or a heat exchanger. The fluid then, by expanding and acting on the
    mechanism of the engine produces motion and usable work.[22] The fluid is then cooled, compressed and reused (closed
    cycle), or (less commonly) dumped, and cool fluid pulled in (open cycle air engine).
    <br/>"Combustion" refers to burning fuel with an oxidizer, to supply the heat. Engines of similar (or even identical)
    configuration and operation may use a supply of heat from other sources such as nuclear, solar, geothermal or
    exothermic reactions not involving combustion; but are not then strictly classed as<em>external combustion engines</em>, but
    as external thermal engines.</p>

<h3><i><strong>4. Air-breathing combustion engines</strong></i></h3>
<p><em>Air-breathing combustion engines</em> are combustion engines that use the oxygen in atmospheric air to oxidise ('burn')
    the fuel, rather than carrying an oxidiser, as in a rocket. Theoretically, this should result in a better specific
    impulse than for rocket engines.
    <br/>A continuous stream of air flows through the air-breathing engine. This air is compressed, mixed with fuel, ignited
    and expelled as the exhaust gas. In reaction engines, the majority of the combustion energy (heat) exits the engine
    as exhaust gas, which provides thrust directly.</p>
