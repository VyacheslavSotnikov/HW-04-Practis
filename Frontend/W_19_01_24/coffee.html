            <h2>Brazil</h2>
                <p>
                Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta
                accounts for the remaining 30%.
                In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing
                cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
                produced almost exclusively.
                Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of
                Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.

            <h2>Colombia</h2>
                <p>
                Colombia has a reputation as producing mild, well balanced coffee beans.
                Colombia's average annual coffee
                production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and Vietnam;
                though highest in terms of the arabica
                bean.
                The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is grown
                in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.

            <h2>India</h2>
                <p>
                Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as
                Indian monsooned coffee".
                Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics
                of Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring.
                The two well known species of coffee grown
                are the Arabica and Robusta.
                Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is
                S.795.

            <h2>Ethiopia</h2>
                <p>
                Ethiopian beans can be divided into 3 categories: Longberry, Shortberry, and Mocha.
                Longberry varieties
                consist of the largest beans and are often considered of the highest quality in both value and flavor.
                Shortberry varieties are smaller.
                The Mocha variety is a highly prized commodity.
                Mocha Harars are known
                for their peaberry beans that often have complex chocolate, spice and citrus notes.

                press.
